# Pomodoro

This is a simple pomodoro project I did to better my react skills, you can choose which mode to start Pomodoro, short/long break, you can change the duration of each mode in settings
I did manage the state initially using the useState hook and then later when I learned about the useReducer I switched to using it, it makes the code very clean amazing react feature !
